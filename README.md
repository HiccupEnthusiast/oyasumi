# Oyasumi  „Åä‰ºë„Åø 

Oyasumi is a library that wraps over multiple APIs related to Anime. The aim of this project is to deliver easily data and functionality to any of your projects. The APIs that this library uses and the media it distributes **are not made by me nor in affiliation to me.** The credits go to their respective creators.

If for any reason you don't want your creation to be used by us you can contact me in Discord `Hicster Enthusiastü™∂#2493` or send me an e-mail at hicster@duck.com. 

### Disclaimer

This project is in a very early phase of development. Expect more features and breaks as we develop the library further!

## Installation

```

## Q&A

- **Q:** Why use this over anything else?

- **A:** This library aims to be a unified and coherent way to interact with various APIs that somehow relate to the Animanga community. We aim to be simple and fast to interact with. If you want something smaller then you may want to interact with the APIs directly

----

- **Q:** What APIs this library wraps over?

- **A:** For the moment we only interact with [waifu.im](https://waifu.im)'s API with plans to support more image databases in the near future and more general purpose APIs at some point.

----

- **Q:** Can you add X?

- **A:** You can add and DM me over Discord so we can talk. Alternatively you can also open an issue/pull request or make your fork with the features you want to see!
----
- **Q:** What's up with the name?

- **A:** "Oyasumi  „Åä‰ºë„Åø" is a Japanese word that's used like "Good night". We choose that name because a) it is distinctive enough and b) most APIs we will work with are REST APIs and our objective is to make you rest easy by providing an easy way to interact with them.
